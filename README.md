# dataquest_exercises
I'm doing a dataquest.io online course for *Data Scientist In Python*

In this repository I want to add my solutions to the exercises.

I also discuss my difficulties and learning outcomes.

There is more discussion about learning to code in my website http://nahusznaj.github.io
